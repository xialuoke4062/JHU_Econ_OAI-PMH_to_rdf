Abstract: This special issue of the Review of Economic Dynamics is dedicated to the legacy of Dale T. Mortensen, one of the leading figures in economics in our lifetime. We are proud and honored to have been assigned the task of contributing some brief introductory remarks on the man and his work, as he was most assuredly an inspiration on both of our careers, and on our lives more generally. The profession has recognized his achievements with many awards, including the 2010 Nobel Prize that he shared with Peter Diamond and Christopher Pissarides. This volume contains articles by several of Dale's many friends, students, coauthors and admirers as a further tribute to his lasting contributions. It is appropriate that the papers appear here, since Dale was a President of the Society for Economic Dynamics, and instrumental in setting up the Review.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a directed search model of the housing market. The pricing mechanism we
analyze reflects the way houses are bought and sold in the United States. Our model is consistent with
the observation that houses are sometimes sold above, sometimes below, and sometimes at the asking
price. We consider two versions of our model. In the first version, all sellers have the same
reservation value. In the second version, there are two seller types, and type is private information.
For both versions, we characterize the equilibrium of the game played by buyers and sellers. Our model
offers a new way to look at the housing market from a search-theoretic perspective. In addition, we
contribute to the directed search literature by considering a model in which the asking price (i)
entails only limited commitment and (ii) has the potential to signal seller type.

Abstract: We develop a life-cycle model of the labor market in which different
worker-firm matches have different quality and the assignment of the right
workers to the right firms is time consuming because of search and learning
frictions. The rate at which workers move between unemployment, employment
and across different firms is endogenous because search is directed and,
hence, workers can choose whether to seek low-wage jobs that are easy to
find or high-wage jobs that are hard to find. We calibrate our theory using
data on labor market transitions aggregated across workers of different
ages. We validate our theory by showing that it predicts quite well the
pattern of labor market transitions for workers of different ages. Finally,
we use our theory to decompose the age profiles of transition rates, wages
and productivity into the effects of age variation in work-life expectancy,
human capital and match quality.

Author-Workplace-Name: University of Wisconsin, Madison
Author-Person:pwr2
Abstract: We develop a model of the venture capital market, focusing on the search process that matches
capitalists with entrepreneurs, and the bargaining problem that splits the surplus. Venture
capitalists go through the following cycle: (1) fund raising; (2) search for a project/partner; (3)
implementation; (4) exit. We study project selection when there are match-specific costs and returns;
decisions to enter the market in the first place; investments during implementation; and fund size.
The model is consistent with the stylized facts, and provides a tractable framework for formalizing
purely descriptive studies of this market.

Abstract: The paper proposes a model of on-the-job search and industry dynamics in which search is directed.
 Firms permanently differ in
productivity levels, their production function features constant returns to scale, and search costs
are convex in search
intensity. Wages are determined in a competitive manner, as firms advertise
wage contracts (expected discounted incomes) so as to balance wage costs and
search costs (queue length). Firms are assumed to sort out their coordination problems with 
their employees in such a way
that the on-the-job search behavior of workers maximizes the match surplus.
Our model has several novel features. First, it is close in spirit to the competitive model, with a
tractable and unique equilibrium, and is therefore useful for empirical testing. Second, on-the-job
search is an efficient response to firm heterogeneities and convex search costs. Third, the
equilibrium
leans towards a job ladder, where unemployed workers apply to low-productivity firms offering low
wages, and then gradually
move on to more productive, higher-paying firms.  With a continuum of firm types, the job ladder is
strict, in the sense that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the productivity of the current
employer and that of the firms she searches for.  The paper also contributes methodologically, as the
existence proof requires a version of Schauder's fixed point theorem that is not commonly used by
economists.   Finally, our model offers different implications for the dynamics of job-to-job
transitions than existing models of random search.

Title: Burdett-Mortensen Model of On-the-Job Search with Two Sectors
Author-Name: Florian Hoffmann

Author-Person:psh12
Abstract: The focus of this paper is on the steady state of a two-sector economy with undirected search where
employed and unemployed workers can search for jobs, both within a sector and between the sectors. As
in the one-sector model, on-the-job search generates wage dispersion among homogeneous workers. The
analysis of the two-sector model uncovers a property called constant tension that is responsible for
analytical tractability. We characterize the steady state in all cases with constant tension. When
time discounting vanishes, constant tension yields the endogenous separation rate in each sector as a
linear function of the present value for a worker. The one-sector economy automatically satisfies
constant tension, in which case the linear separation rate implies that equilibrium offers of the
worker value are uniformly distributed. Constant tension also has strong predictions for worker
transitions and value/wage dispersion, both within a sector and between the two sectors. When
constant tension does not hold, we compute the steady state numerically and illustrate its properties.

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to study why some workers are paid more than
others. To do so we construct and quantitatively assess an equilibrium
search model with on-the-job search, general human capital accumulation and two sided heterogeneity. In
the model workers differ in abilities and firms
differ in their productivities. The model generates a simple (log) wage
variance decomposition that is used to measure the importance of firm and
worker productivity differentials, frictional wage dispersion and workers'
sorting dynamics. We calibrate the model using a sample of young workers 
from the UK. We show that heterogeneity among firms generates great
deal of wage inequality. Among low skilled workers job ladder effects are
small, most of the impact of experience on wages is due to
learning-by-doing. High skilled workers are much more mobile. Job ladder
effects have sizeable impact.

Abstract: e provide a quantitative exploration of business cycles in a frictional labor market under
contract-posting. The steady-state random search and wage-posting model of Burdett and Mortensen
(1998) has become the canonical structural framework for empirical analysis of worker turnover and
equilibrium wage dispersion. In this paper, we provide an efficient algorithm to simulate a dynamic
stochastic equilibrium version of this model, the Stochastic Burdett-Mortensen model, and evaluate its
performance against empirical evidence on fluctuations in unemployment, vacancies and wages.

Title: Capital Values and Job Values
Author-Name: Eran Yashiv
Author-Workplace-Name: Tel Aviv University
Author-Person:pya27
Abstract: This paper explores how the joint behavior of hiring and investment is governed by the expected
present values of capital and of jobs. It uses a model of frictions, which is a combination of a
search model of the labor market and a q-type model of the capital market, emphasizing the interaction
of capital and labor frictions. Relying on structural estimation of private sector U.S. data, it
studies the future determinants of capital and job values and the implications for U.S. labor market
developments.
Key findings include: (i)  complementarity between the hiring and investment processes; (ii) important
cross effects, of the value of capital on the mean and the volatility of the hiring rate, and vice
versa; (iii) future returns are shown to play a dominant role in determining capital and job values;
and (iv) U.S. labor market developments, including the outward shift of the Beveridge curve in the
Great Recession and its aftermath 2007-2013, can be accounted for by changes in job and capital
values. A relatively surprising finding is that job values went up, not down, in the Great Recession.

Abstract: We develop an empirical search-matching model which is suitable for
analyzing the wage, employment and welfare impact of regulation in
a labor market with heterogeneous workers and jobs. To achieve this
we develop an equilibrium model of wage determination and employment
which extends the current literature on equilibrium wage determination
with matching and provides a bridge between some of the most prominent
macro models and microeconometric research. The model incorporates
productivity shocks, long-term contracts, on-the-job search and counter-offers.
Importantly, the model allows for the possibility of assortative matching
between workers and jobs due to complementarities between worker and
job characteristics. We use the model to estimate the potential gain
from optimal regulation and we consider the potential gains and redistributive
impacts from optimal unemployment insurance policy. Here optimal policy
is defined as that which maximizes total output and home production,
accounting for the various constraints that arise from search frictions.
The model is estimated on the NLSY using the method of moments.

Title: Optimal Growth Through Product Innovation
Author-Name: Rasmus Lentz

Author-Name: Dale Mortensen
Author-Person:pmo42
Abstract: In Lentz et al. (2008), we formulate and estimate a market equilibrium model of endogenous growth
through product innovation. In this paper, we provide quantitative equilibrium solutions to the model
based on our parameter estimates, and compare them with a social planner's solution. We find that the
socially optimal growth rate is double that of the market equilibrium growth rate when firm
differences in the ability to create productive products are highly persistent as a consequence of the
"business stealing" externality present in the model. The welfare loss of the decentralized economy
relative to that of the planner is equivalent to a 21% tax on the planner consumption path. The
planner's solution differs from the decentralized economy in that it discourages innovation by low
ability innovators as well as entry.
We introduce two mechanisms that temper the strength of the negative externality: Transitory firm
types and the possibility of buyouts. We show that both sharply reduce the inefficiency due to
innovation by low ability innovators. But with caveats: If firm types are completely transitory, then
the notion of firm heterogeneity is for practical purposes lost. Buyouts improve efficiency, but the
efficiency gain depends significantly on the strength of the innovator's ability to extract rents from
incumbents through the buyout.

Title: Search-and-Matching Analysis of High Unemployment Caused by the Zero Lower Bound
Author-Name: Robert E. Hall
Author-Workplace-Name: Stanford University
Author-Person:pha128
Abstract: A basic principle of macroeconomics holds that an excessive real interest rate is the cause of high
unemployment at the zero lower bound on the nominal interest rate. Absent the bound, the rate could be
negative and the real rate could be low enough to restore full employment. Models backing up this
principle make controversial assumptions about price-stickiness and the failure of market-clearing in
the product market and sometimes in the labor market. This paper generates realistic effects of the
zero lower bound without those assumptions, by substituting a search-and-matching
setup in both the product and labor markets.

Abstract: We introduce ex-ante heterogeneity between workers and two technology shocks, neutral and
investment-specific, as the driving forces into the basic Mortensen-Pissarides search and matching
model. The calibrated model is simultaneously consistent with a strong response of labor market
variables to cyclical fluctuations in productivity and a weaker response to changes in taxes found in
cross-country data. The model also matches the evidence that countries with higher tax rates have
higher aggregate productivity, lower skill premia, and higher unemployment rates among both high- and
low-skilled workers. The key mechanism that allows us to achieve these results is that aggregate and
group-specific productivities are endogenous and respond to changes in tax policy.
